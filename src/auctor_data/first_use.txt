1.1.3 Expansion A: After you have identified the simplest answer, expand upon how you will go about implementing it.
1.1.4 Expantion B: If you cannot find any answer to the problem, gather data to try and make a reasonable attempt.
1.1.5 Troubleshooting: Try your now expanded upon solution and see if it works. Come at it with the attitude of someone who wants to solve the problem, if you do not you are doomed to fail.

2/6/2023: I think these past 2-3 weeks have been the most wild weeks of my life. To start off, this year I have been doing a lot better as far as schooling, getting all As except for one 3.471 A- in Math(an A is 3.49 or higher) which is annoying but still compared to last year I am doing a lot better. At the start of the year I joined a bunch of clubs and would frequent meetings, and I still do but my clubs include Coding Club, TSA, Debate, Buisness, and AI Club. Coding Club basically never has meetings, TSA has meeting and I go to them regularly(there was actually one today), Debate at least for me is closed off because all that is left in the year is regionals and nationals and my debate(impromptu)
